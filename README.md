# Not-Latex

This is a latex-inspired processor which takes a text file as input and outputs an HTML file with the proper styles and formatting.

It allows for Latex-like math to be used (using MathJax) and it supports Markdown.

## Example

To convert a file named "file.txt" simple use
```
node index.js file.txt
```
And an HTML file with the name "file" will be created.
